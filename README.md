## Hey there! 👋

I’m **Suraj**, an AI/ML student and developer based in India.

I design, build, and break things (in that order… sometimes).  
If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll prototype it at 3 AM and figure out the bugs later.

My main tech stack is **Python, Html, JS, CSS and Godot ENGINE(GD Script)**.  
I love working on **AI/ML, game development, and web projects**.  
Currently learning **DSA** and diving deeper into **3D game dev**.

I’ve built a bunch of fun projects like **Lost in Darkness**, **Bacteria Builder**,  
and my ongoing FPS project **Wavebreaker**.

I also make music —  
yep, I’m a **singer–songwriter**, and I occasionally upload covers on YouTube.

If you want to see what I’m experimenting with,  
my projects are all around here 👇

### Fun Facts

- I’ve been a video editor for 3+ years 🎬  
- I love building games, learning new tech, and breaking things just to fix them again  
- **Hobbies:** guitar, singing, gym, football, building random projects 🚀
